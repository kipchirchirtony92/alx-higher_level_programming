# Python - import & modules

In this project, I learned about importing and using functions and cre\
ating
modules in Python. I further practiced using the builtin function
`dir()` and using command line arguments within Python programs.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Import a simple function from a simple file**
  * [0-add.py](./0-add.py): Python program that imports the function
  `def add(a, b):` from the file [add_0.py](./add_0.py) and prints the
  result of the addition `1 + 2 = 3`.
  * Output: `<a value> + <b value> = <add(a, b) value>` followed by a \
new line.

* **1. My first toolbox!**
  * [1-calculation.py](./1-calculation.py): Python program that import\
s functions
  from the file [calculator_1.py](./1-calculator.py) and prints the re\
sult
  of the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of `10` an\
d `5`.
  * Output: `<a value> <operator> <b value> = <operation(a, b) value>`\
 followed by a new line.

* **2. How to make a script dynamic!**
  * [2-args.py](./2-args.py): Python program that prints the number of
  and list of its arguments.
  * Output: `[Number of arguments] argument` (if number is one) or `ar\
guments` (otherwise), followed by:
    * `:` (or `.` if no argumets were passed), followed by
    * A new line, followed by
    * One argument per line - the position of the argument (starting a\
t `1`) followed by `:` followed by the argument value and another new \
